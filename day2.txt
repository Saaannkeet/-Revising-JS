que1:: Different Data types available in JavaScript ?
ans::there are two type of data type
 Primitive:–
 undefined
 Boolean
 Number
 String
 BigInt
 Symbol 
 non-Primitive:–
 Object 
 Array


que2:: In how many ways we can declare variable ? what is difference between them.
ans:: there are three ways to declarea variable
1)var 
2)let
3)const
var keyword is oldest keyword and let and const are introduced in es6. 
var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. 
var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; 
let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. 
They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined,
let and const variables are not initialized. 
While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.



que3:: What is Hoisting ?
ans::Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, function declarations and classes are moved to the 
top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation. 


que4:: What is Temporal Dead Zone ?
ans :: The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the
 let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before 
 its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. 


que5::What is difference between == and === operators ?
ans:: == and ===are the comparison operators in java JavaScript
 They always return the value true or false.
 In == operators it comparing only the value
 In === operators it comparing the value as well as data type

que6:: What are the different type of operators in javascript ?
ans:: There are various operators supported by JavaScript as below,

1] Arithmetic Operators: 
Includes + (Addition),– (Subtraction), * (Multiplication),
 / (Division), % (Modulus), + + (Increment) and – – (Decrement)

2] Comparison Operators: 
Includes = =(Equal),!= (Not Equal), ===(Equal with type), 
> (Greater than),> = (Greater than or Equal to),< (Less than),
<= (Less than or Equal to)

3] Logical Operators: Includes &&(Logical AND),||(Logical OR),!(Logical NOT)

4] Assignment Operators: Includes = (Assignment Operator), += (Add and Assignment Operator), 
– = (Subtract and Assignment Operator), *= (Multiply and Assignment), /= (Divide and Assignment),
 %= (Modules and Assignment)

5] Ternary Operators: It includes conditional(: ?) Operator

6] typeof Operator: It uses to find type of variable.
